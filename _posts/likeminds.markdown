LikeMinds brings together people and communities around common interests.
We are a messaging app and we help communities engage deeper by enabling real-time conversations between relevant members in shared chat rooms. We also dramatically reduce spam and foster collaboration by applying technology. [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collabmates)

**Features:**

- CHATROOMS: All chats happen within chatrooms in a community. You can create your own chatroom or follow the ones which interest you. This allows you to have parallel conversations without getting lost in chat streams.

- RELEVANT NOTIFICATIONS: We won't bug you with irrelevant notifications. Within a community, you get notifications for only new chatrooms and for the chatrooms you are already following.

- MEMBER PROFILES: You can create a unique profile for each community you join and also see similar, community-specific profiles of other members. This allows you to collaborate better with other members because you know what value they bring around specific topics.

- COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TOOLS: You donâ€™t have to go to 3rd party sites or apps to create polls, host events, or publish newsletters. We have inbuilt these tools inside LikeMinds to offer you a seamless experience.
